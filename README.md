📊 Data Analytics Project
Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data loading, exploration, cleaning, SQL-based analysis, and business-focused visualization. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from raw data and present them through an interactive dashboard and a concise report suitable for stakeholders.

Dataset

Source: (Public / Company-provided / Synthetic dataset — mention clearly)

Format: CSV

Description:
The dataset contains structured records related to (customers / sales / orders / transactions — update as needed), including numerical, categorical, and date-based fields used for analysis and reporting.

Tools & Technologies

Programming: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Databases: PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

Data Visualization: Power BI

Presentation: Gamma (PPT)

Reporting: Markdown / PDF / Power BI Report

IDE: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

Project Workflow

Data Loading

Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas.

Verified schema, data types, and basic integrity.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions, trends, and correlations.

Identified missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Generated visual summaries for key metrics.

Data Cleaning & Transformation

Handled missing and null values.

Corrected data types and standardized columns.

Removed duplicates and irrelevant records.

Created derived features for deeper analysis.

SQL Analysis

Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server.

Wrote optimized SQL queries using:

JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING

Window functions

Subqueries and CTEs

Extracted business insights directly from the database.

Dashboard Development

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard.

Included KPIs, trends, filters, and drill-downs.

Designed for clarity and business decision-making.

Reporting & Presentation

Created a structured analytical report summarizing insights.

Developed a professional presentation using Gamma to communicate results to stakeholders.

Dashboard Highlights

Key performance indicators (KPIs)

Trend analysis over time

Segmentation by category / region / customer type

Interactive filters and slicers

Business-focused visual storytelling

Results & Insights

Identified key trends and patterns impacting performance.

Highlighted data-driven opportunities for improvement.

Provided actionable insights supported by SQL analysis and visual evidence.

(Add 2–3 bullet points with concrete findings if possible — recruiters love this.)
